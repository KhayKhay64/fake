	<h1>Unsafe Abortion</h1>

	<div style="width: 70%;" "text-align: left;" "padding-left: 10px;">
	<p>
		<b>An unsafe abortion</b> is the termination of a pregnancy by people lacking the necessary skills, or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.<br> An unsafe abortion is a life-threatening procedure. It includes self-induced abortions, abortions in unhygienic conditions, and abortions performed by a medical practitioner who does not provide appropriate post-abortion attention.<br> About 25 million unsafe abortions occur a year, of which most occur in the developing world.
	</p><br>

	<p>
    	<b>Unsafe abortion</b> remains one of the five leading causes of maternal mortality. More than 22,000 women die each year after having an unsafe abortion, according to a comprehensive report in 2018.

    <p> Since 1990 the world has made significant progress to reduce the other main causes of maternal deaths yet there has been little improvement to diminish the dangers of unsafe abortion. Every year, worldwide, about 42 million women with unintended pregnancies choose abortion, and nearly half of these procedures are unsafe.
    </p>

    <p>Some women die of unsafe abortion, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. Women who survived will suffer long-term health complications. Unsafe abortion is thus a pressing issue.
    </p><br>

    <p>Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion face obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions occur. Even where these obstacles are overcome, women and health care providers need to be educated about the safety of abortion, and women need better access to safe services. Otherwise, women, facing the burdens and believing they have no other option, will continue to risk their lives.</p>

    <p>Unsafe abortion was and is a public health crisis. More specifically, lack of access to safe abortion was and is a public health risk. The more restrictive the law, the higher the rates of death and other complications.
