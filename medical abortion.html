    <p>Medical abortion is a procedure that uses medicine to end a pregnancy. It doesn't require surgery or what-so-ever. It can be started in a medical office or at home with follow-up visits to your provider. It's safest and most effective during the first trimester of pregnancy. It is also a major decision with consequences. If you're considering this, make sure you understand everything about it.</p>

    <p>In-clinic abortion works by using suction to take a pregnancy out of your uterus. Your doctor  or nurse will know which type is right for you. Suction abortion (also called vacuum aspiration) is the most common type of in-clinic abortion. It uses gentle suction to empty your uterus. It’s usually used until about 14-16 weeks after your last period. Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) is another kind of in-clinic abortion procedure.<i>It uses suction and medical tools to empty your uterus;</i> if it has been 16 weeks or longer since your last period.</p>

    <p>Medication abortion can be done with abortion pill which is a safe and effective way to end an early pregnancy; which is very effective. The effectiveness depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy. “Abortion pill” is the common name for using two different medicines to end a pregnancy: mifepristone and misoprostol. Pregnancy needs a hormone called progesterone to grow normally. Mifepristone blocks your body’s own progesterone, stopping the pregnancy from growing. Then you take the second medicine, misoprostol, either right away or up to 48 hours later. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding to empty your uterus. It’s kind of like having a really heavy, crampy period, and the process is very similar to an early miscarriage. If you don’t have any bleeding within 24 hours after taking the second medicine, call your nurse or doctor; because you should be bleeding.</p>
